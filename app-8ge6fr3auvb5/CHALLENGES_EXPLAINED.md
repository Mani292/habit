# Understanding Challenges (Group Challenges)

## What Are Challenges?

**Challenges** are group activities where multiple users work together toward a common habit goal. Think of them as **group challenges** or **community challenges** where people join together to stay motivated and accountable.

## How Challenges Work

### The Concept
A challenge is like a **group competition** or **accountability group** where:
- One person creates a challenge with a specific habit goal
- Other users can join the challenge
- Everyone works on the same habit together
- Participants can see how many people are in the challenge
- Everyone tracks their progress toward the same goal

### Example Scenarios

**Example 1: 30-Day Reading Challenge**
- **Creator**: Sarah creates "30-Day Reading Challenge"
- **Habit**: "Read 10 pages"
- **Goal**: Complete 30 days of reading
- **Duration**: January 1 - January 30
- **Participants**: 15 people join the challenge
- **Result**: Everyone reads together and stays motivated as a group

**Example 2: Morning Exercise Challenge**
- **Creator**: John creates "Morning Exercise Challenge"
- **Habit**: "Morning workout"
- **Goal**: Complete 21 days of exercise
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Participants**: 8 people join
- **Result**: Group accountability helps everyone stick to morning workouts

## Key Features

### 1. Create a Challenge
Any user can create a challenge by specifying:
- **Challenge Name**: e.g., "30-Day Meditation Challenge"
- **Description**: What the challenge is about
- **Habit Name**: The specific habit to track (e.g., "Meditate 10 minutes")
- **Start Date**: When the challenge begins
- **End Date**: When the challenge ends
- **Target Days**: How many days to complete (e.g., 30 days)
- **Public/Private**: Whether others can see and join

### 2. Join a Challenge
Users can:
- Browse all available challenges
- See how many participants are in each challenge
- Join any active or upcoming challenge
- Leave a challenge if needed

### 3. Track Progress
Each participant:
- Tracks their own progress (days completed)
- Sees their completion percentage
- Views the total number of participants
- Stays motivated by being part of a group

### 4. Challenge Status
Challenges have three statuses:
- **Upcoming**: Not started yet (can join)
- **Active**: Currently running (can join)
- **Ended**: Finished (cannot join)

## Why "Groups" = "Challenges"

The term **"groups"** refers to the **group of people** participating in a challenge together. When you see:

- **"Join group challenges"** = Join challenges with other people
- **"Group accountability"** = Stay accountable with your challenge group
- **"Community challenges"** = Challenges where the community participates together

It's all referring to the **Challenges** feature where multiple users form a **group** to work on the same habit goal.

## Summary

**Challenges = Group Challenges**

The "Challenges" feature is all about **group participation** where multiple users join together to work on the same habit goal. When you see references to "groups" in the context of challenges, it means:

- **Group of participants** working together
- **Community accountability** through shared goals
- **Social motivation** from being part of a team
- **Collective progress** toward a common objective

It's a powerful feature that leverages **social accountability** and **community support** to help users build better habits together!
