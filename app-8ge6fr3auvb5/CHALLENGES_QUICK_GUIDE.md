# Challenges Quick Guide

## What Are Challenges?

**Challenges = Group Challenges**

Multiple users working together on the same habit goal.

## Simple Explanation

```
Challenge: "30-Day Reading Challenge"
├── Creator: Sarah
├── Habit: "Read 10 pages"
├── Duration: 30 days
├── Target: Complete 30 days
└── Participants (Group):
    ├── Sarah (15 days completed)
    ├── John (20 days completed)
    ├── Emma (18 days completed)
    ├── Mike (22 days completed)
    └── ... (11 more people)
    
Total: 15 participants = 15-person GROUP
```

## The "Group" Concept

When we say **"group challenges"**, we mean:

- **Group** = All the people who joined the challenge
- **Challenge** = The shared habit goal everyone is working on
- **Participants** = Members of the group

### Example:

**"Join group challenges"** means:
- Join challenges where OTHER PEOPLE are also participating
- Be part of a GROUP working on the same habit
- Stay accountable with your GROUP members

## How It Works

### Step 1: Someone Creates a Challenge
```
Sarah creates: "Morning Meditation Challenge"
- Habit: Meditate 10 minutes
- Duration: 21 days
- Status: Open for anyone to join
```

### Step 2: People Join (Form a Group)
```
Participants join:
1. Sarah (creator)
2. John
3. Emma
4. Mike
5. Lisa
... and more

Now you have a GROUP of people!
```

### Step 3: Everyone Tracks Progress
```
Each person in the GROUP:
- Completes the habit daily
- Tracks their days completed
- Sees how many others are in the group
- Stays motivated by group accountability
```

### Step 4: Challenge Ends
```
After 21 days:
- Sarah: 21/21 days ✅
- John: 19/21 days
- Emma: 21/21 days ✅
- Mike: 18/21 days
- Lisa: 20/21 days

The GROUP worked together!
```
